## Description of Notebooks

There are some experimental notebooks here. They were used for self education and experimentation and fuel the actual python code.

||Notebook|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|1|[extract-knowledge](extract-knowledge.ipynb)|If knowledge is delivered in a prompt using text, or more structured format, does the performance change|
|2|[langchain-neo4j-3](./langchain-neo4j-3.ipynb)|Basic experiment with [Langchain cypher agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/graph/graph_cypher_qa)|
|3|[langchain-neo4j-template-4](./langchain-neo4j-template-4.ipynb)|Same as the earlier Notebook but experimenting now by adding hints using prompts|
|4|[langchain-postgres-1](./langchain-postgres-1.ipynb)|Using SQLDBChain - we will not use this|
|5|[langchain-postgres-sqlagent-2](./langchain-postgres-sqlagent-2.ipynb)|Using [SQL REACT Agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql#case-3-sql-agents) with Search DB (you will have to have a search database available)|
